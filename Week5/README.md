## Summary

**Steps Followed:**
Installed OpenROAD in WSL Ubuntu 22.04 by running dependency setup script, building from source with single-threaded compilation to optimize memory usage, sourcing environment variables, and executing the complete RTL-to-GDSII design flow on the default GCD design.

**Challenges & Solutions:**
Initial build failures were caused by gtest linking errors and out-of-memory issues with 8 threads; resolved by using `-DENABLE_DIST_TESTS=OFF` flag to skip test compilation and reducing threads to 1 for stable memory management in WSL environment.
